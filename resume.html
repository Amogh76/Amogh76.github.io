           by actively participating in online user forums and integrating feedback to make this app more user friendly.
        </p>
        <p>The final project of the Python class was to draw the American flag and the Olympic rings. 
           My code used the built in turtle function to draw the flag.  
           It used a drawcircle function I made in order to draw the rings. 
           Additionally, I manipulated the turtle into having a map of the US as a backdrop. 
           I used the turtle.write function to write “USA Olympic team” at the top in blue bold font. 
           The code uses the turtle, loops and functions all throughout the program. 
           This code does the Olympic rings and American flag drawings so that the user doesn't have to draw it out by themselves.</p>
